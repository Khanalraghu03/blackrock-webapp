            <h2>Penny Stocks</h2>
            <p>
                Penny stocks are very risky. Most of the people fear investing their money on stocks
                because of the stories they have heard from people who invest in penny stocks.

                Penny stocks are like playing a lottery, you could lose all you money in few hours or make
                lot of money within in a few hours. Those who invest in penny stocks are usually are under assumptions
                instead of being lead by "facts" about companies' product, services, reputation and so on.

                A lot of people get into penny stocks and end of losing a lot of money.

            </p>
            <h2>What is considered a penny stocks?</h2>
            <p>Any stock that is $5 or less of worth is considered a penny stock. They can sometimes go way up or
            come way back down. Most of the time, these stocks are manipulated and not really speculated.</p>

            <h2>Investing in big company</h2>
            <p>Investing in companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google etc are way less risky.
            By evaluating the company Microsoft, it has at least 10% return on investment per year.
                If you compare that to your regular saving account, which is usually 0.03%. It is way wiser
                to invest than to save your money on savings account.
            </p>

            <h2>Compound Interest</h2>
            <p>Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit,
                or in other words, interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather
                than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal
                sum plus previously accumulated interest. </p>
